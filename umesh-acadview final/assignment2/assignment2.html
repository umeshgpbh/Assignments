            <h2 style="background-color:turquoise;">Shahi Paneer</h2>
            <img src="shahipaneer.jpg">
            <blockquote>Shahi Paneer
a rich Indian dish that can grace any special occasion, paneer is cooked in creamy makhni sauce. In this gravy cashewnuts add that shahi or royal touch.  Delicately flavoured with aromatic spices the sauce is full of flavours from tomatoes, butter, cashewnuts and cream. It does come with its share of calories, but one bite and you will realize it is all worth it. Freezing a batch of makhani sauce comes in handy as you can dish up a number of delicious versions of this dish, using vegetables or grilled chicken instead of paneer.For other receipes please click <a href="#recipes"> here</a></blockquote>
